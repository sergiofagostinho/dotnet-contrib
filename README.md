# Invisible Objects .NET contrib
This repository is my humble contribution for .NET developers out there, including myself in the future, in the form of a library.

##Purpose
I currently don't have the ambition to actually distribute this as a library _per se_ (i.e. as a NuGet package), there are some projects out there to do that. I'm currently more focused on sharing my developer experience on good practices, and hopefully getting some feedback. This is also a support tool to my blog (http://sergioagostinho-dev.blogspot.pt/).

##Structure
There are currently two major namespaces:
* `InvisibleObjects.Contrib.Util`: classes that you could use in production code.
* `InvisibleObjects.Contrib.Test`: classes that you could use in test code.

In any case, packages _may_ change in the future.

##What do I need to build or use this code?

All the code is written for .NET framework 4.0, using Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition. Some code should run in older versions of the framework, though.

##License

MIT, just because it's the most simple. Although most of the code is based on something which I've used professionally, use it at your own risk. Some of the code is taken or adapted from StackOverflow or some blog, and in that case, I provide a link to the source.
